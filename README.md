# RPATA
RPATA (PATA is Swahili for 'find') is a minimilist, multicast-based peer discovery service library. It can be used as to complement existing networking libraries( e.g. ZMQ) by providing discovery service typically to offered by them. Also if your only choice of using DDS/RTPS is beacause of its in-built discovery service, then RPATA+ `your favourire networking library` could be an better alternative.

# Disclaimer!!

RPATA is still under heavy development and things are bound to change.
